You can use one of app structure for your projects.

By default, all flask apps use library 
[Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
because I think this library add more flexibility to API.

## List of flask apps

- [Simple flask app](https://github.com/gurkin33/flask_simple_apps/tree/main/app1_simple_flask). 
As describe in the name it only represents simple API.
- [Flask and Sqlalchemy](https://github.com/gurkin33/flask_simple_apps/tree/main/app2_flask_sqlalchemy).
This API can work with databases. It has CRUD feature for users, also 
you can find there validation.
